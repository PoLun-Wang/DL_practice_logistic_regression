# Deep Learning practice - Logistic Regression
 - We use an easier way to reduce the complexity of the programs for beginners who study machine learning. Therefore, we hope it can be easier to understand and implement the multi-layer computation of backpropagation.
 - These programs are basically modified from the exams in "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" on Coursera. If you want a comprehensive explanation or any tutorial videos, I recommended you enroll in the course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" on Coursera.
 - If you need more information or you are a beginner in deep learning, you could go to my website.
