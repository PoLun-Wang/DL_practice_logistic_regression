# Deep Learning practice - Logistic Regression
 - These programs are basically modified from the exams in "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" on Coursera.
 - If you want a comprehensive explanation or any tutorial videos, I recommended you enroll in the course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" on Coursera.
 - If you need more information or you are a beginner in deep learning, you could go to my website.
